# Page Templates

It's simple to add new pages to Goldydoc. 

Any new page starts with a block of metadata like this:

```
---
Title: Example Page
Date: 2022-09-12
slug: example 
---
```

Note that adding a slug isn't always necessary as the path to your page is also determined in large part by the page's location in the `/content` folder.

From there, you can include all of the usual niceties of [GitHub flavored Mardown](), Hugo's [built in support](https://gohugo.io/categories/content-management) for additional types of markdown content, or the features built into the [site theme](https://geekdocs.de/usage/).
