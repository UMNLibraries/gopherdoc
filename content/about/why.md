Because I said so, duh.

But seriously.

Hugo is a static site generator written in `go`. It is extremely fast and distributed in binaries that should 'just work' on most MacOS, BSD, or even Linux systems without additional dependencies. It is also widely distributed in system port trees/package mangers.

## Will Hugo trigger head spinning?

Only from joy! Hugo effictively meets all of the criteria specified in prior discussions:

| Criteria Met | Notes | Criteria Unmet |
|:----------|:-------------|:---------|
| Uses Markdown |  | 
| Access Control | |
| versioning (via `git`)| |
| revision/editing control  | |
| not exclusively on CLI (by virtue of GitHub web) | requires some manual intervention for deployment | |
| Automatically generate sidebar (based on `/content` hierarchy) | |
