# Welcome to (not) Goldydoc!

Goldydoc is an effort to collaboratively build a University Libraries IT documentation system that is **accessible, legible, and convenient**.[^1]

[^1]: '(not) Goldydoc' is used in this site so as to not run afoul of UMN Communications and marketing

It was developed originally as part of University of Minnesota Libraries IT departmental discussions aimed at improving the creation and management of our documentation.

## Google (where are the) Docs

google docs oh no

## Documentation System Requirements

0. No new system to support/deploy/worry about updates (e.g., Dokuwiki, MediaWiki, etc.) 
1. uses a standard flavor of Markdown
2. access control
3. versioning
4. revision control, ie., file an issue/use git branches etc.
5. preferably not exclusively CLI based/accessible for non-techies
6. automatically generate/manage navigation sidebar

### Additional Requirements I Added
- "aspirational compliance" with both the Libraries' [Design System](https://umnlibraries.github.io) and [University branding guidelines](https://university-relations.umn.edu/brand)
- no webfonts/3rd Party hosted JS
- any simple page like this one should be < 500kb or it's [too big](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)
