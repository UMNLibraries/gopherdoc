# Welcome to Gopherdoc!

Gopherdoc is an effort to collaboratively build a University Libraries IT documentation system that is **accessible, legible, and convenient**. We can do it in a way that creates minimal hurdles for non-techies to use, without relying on third-party services, adding substantial costs, or creating an additional system admin burden. We can make it lightweight and not require megabytes of JavaScript like other publishing systems or third-party documentation tools.

It was developed originally as part of University of Minnesota Libraries IT departmental discussions aimed at improving the creation and management of our internal documentation.

## Google (where are the) Docs

## Documentation System Requirements

0. No new system to support/deploy/worry about updates (e.g., Dokuwiki, MediaWiki, etc.) 
1. uses a standard flavor of Markdown
2. access control
3. versioning
4. revision control, ie., file an issue/use git branches etc.
5. preferably not exclusively CLI based/accessible for non-techies
6. automatically generate/manage navigation sidebar

### Additional Requirements I Added
- "aspirational compliance" with both the Libraries' [Design System](https://umnlibraries.github.io) and [University branding guidelines](https://university-relations.umn.edu/brand)
- no webfonts/3rd Party hosted JS
- any simple page like this one should be < 500kb or it's [too big](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)
